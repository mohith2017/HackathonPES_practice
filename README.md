# Hackathon_Pragyan
App to be made at the hackathon

App idea:
To provide the details of the stadium that is free for playing of the sport to be hosted at the specific places.


Differences from Weather app:
1) Streamlines the runtime availability of free places to play the sport
2) It is going to have more info about the stadiums and their conditions of utilisation at that instant of time based on weather conditions
